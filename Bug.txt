In ViiRaa iOS app, user `dev@viiraa.com` logged in. In the Apple Health app, it shows the following data.

<Blood Glucose Data>
December 1, 2025: 120 mg/dl
December 2, 2025: 123 mg/dl
December 11, 2025: 124 mg/dl
</Blood Glucose Data>

But in `https://app.junction.com/team/40f5717b-bba1-47f6-90d2-d59d41747b04/sandbox/user/5c9657f5-c5cf-47fb-ac64-9f0774604445/wearables`, although I can see that user_id `5c9657f5-c5cf-47fb-ac64-9f0774604445` shows Apple Health is connected, but I cannot find the Blood Glucose Data for this user.
